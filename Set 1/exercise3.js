//Exercise 3
//
//In a faraway country, there is a single farm which contains apples.
//The farm is surrounded by three concentric fences, each one of them guarded by a guard.
//Mister XY wished to get through the fences and eat ONE apple so he went to the first guard and reached an
//
//agreement:
//
//He would give the guard half the apples he would bring back plus half an additional apple.
//The guard agreed, indicating that he only wanted full apples (e.g. if he brought back three apples, one and half
//wouldn’t do for the guard, so Mister XY would give two to the guard and keep one for himself). Consider that
//giving two of fours apples to the guard won't be valid, because it doesn’t take into account the additional half.
//Mr XY reached the same agreement with the remaining two guards.
//
//Consequently, how many apples must Mr XY cut to fulfill the agreements and have just the one apple he
//wishes when leaving the fences?
//How would you generalize this algorithm in a method that returns the number of apples when provided with
//the number of fences?
//
//double ApplesByFences(int fences){...}
